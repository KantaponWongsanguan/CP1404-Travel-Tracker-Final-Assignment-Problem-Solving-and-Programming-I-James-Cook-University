# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Kantapong Wongsanguan

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
I completed this assignment on multiple days since June 1st. Though I did not record the exact time it took and time for reviewing the app, the estimation would be around 15-20 hours. ( 3d, 4h each, (3rd ~6h))
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The most satisfaction being when the codes and the app finally worked accordingly despite the lengthy hours it took.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
There were some codes where it should be pretty forward and I should have been able to code it without looking back to the lecture notes and the example, however it is what it is, there were little parts of the code where I could not get it right without addition lecture notes. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I would say the early foundation of what was taught in earlier weeks were really fundamentally needed. The hours it took to increase the understanding of those structure taught really paid off in developing the app brick by brick.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Consistent Time management. During the process, I took sometime off to study other subject modules as well. During the time off, I kept having ideas about how to solve the problems and how to improve the codes which it would definitely be better for me to just sit down and finish the programme in a more consistent period within one or two weeks.
In addition to creating organised schedules instead of do it whenever I felt like, utilizing learning resources more instead of going at the code alone for hours would and seeking clarification from lecturer would be one of the first thing I do in a project like this, since in the end, the purpose is not to just test myself but to complete the task optimally without wasting time more than intended too.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I mostly refer back to the lecture pptx, notes , and further provided subject materials. The structure of the app was similarly taught in the weekly practical sessions while the extended exercises given was really helpful as well.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Time management and understanding more complex concepts. The main challenges were as previous mentioned, time management with the addition of more complex concepts. Understanding the structures of the program as intended, I made a mistake where I did not make clear pseudocode. I kinda made the pseudocode in the notes as I went along completing the codes task by tasks and in the end the function methods in the Class did not follow the SRP rules at all. Making clear pseudocode would be beneficial in my case since to overcome these challenges, I implemented strategies along the ways as I progress which I can see now is not at all optimal.
In terms of coding, I overcame those obstacles by simplified and improving my codes structure in organised way. this allowed me to encapsulate data and functions, create reusable code, and achieve code extensibility through inheritance ,which I think enhancing the code readability and facilitated future modifications. 

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Reflecting on the classes, there are several areas in my process that I could improve for the future. 
Simplifying and use pseudocode for better code structures would really improve my codes for the next time. In summary, planning, time management, communication (to lecturer), testing, documentation, and reflection each coding session will definitely lead to improved project outcomes for the next one.
Overall, experiences with using classes taught me, mostly in resilience and problem-solving more complex tasks efficiency in a more organised way.
